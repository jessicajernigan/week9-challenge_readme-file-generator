  ## Description  
  Don't let another README file be an afterthought that you rush to tack onto the end of a project. This handy command-line-based README generator application will not only prompt you for the key details that any great README file should offer, but formats your answers into a professional-looking end product that will impress your future users as much as it educates them. 

  ## Usage
  * Initialize the application with the command ```node index```
  * Follow the prompts to enter key details about your project (e.g. 'Description', 'Installtion', etc...)
  * Enter your Github username (which will be linked in the file) and an email address for users to contact you with questions
  * Your custom README file will be generated in the ```README-generated.md``` file
